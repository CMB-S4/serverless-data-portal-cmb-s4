# Data Release: Planck Public Release 4 (Planck PR4)

## Description

The Planck Public Release 4 is the latest reprocessing of both LFI and HFI instruments data using a common pipeline, NPIPE.
The effect of the joint analysis is lower levels of noise and systematics in both frequency and component maps at essentially all angular scales, as well as notably improved internal consistency between the various frequency channels.

For more information about the pipeline and the data products, please see:
